# Altair-8800-computer

#### the *altair 8800 computer* was the first ever commercial succesful personal computer. I was based on the intel 8080 Cpu which had ~~64 Kb of ram~~ and an `8bit microprocessor`. A kit cost $439 and two types of memory boards were available: a 1024-word memory board ($176) and a 4096-word memory board ($264). Later Roberts offered also a parallel interface board ($92), two types of serial interface boards, an audio cassette interface board and Teletype. Altair 8800â€™s expansion bus allowed MITS to sell additional memory and interface boards. The RAM provided was only 256 bytes and users had to purchase its memory board separately. The system originally came with 1024 bytes of storage but it allowed you to buy extra storage.
